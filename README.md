Yeah, isn't that much, but for a guy that just studied the language for 2 weeks and tried something, It's a start!

## What was my intentions 
I was trying to challenge myself to see if I was understanding the language, and if I was already able to do a project by myself, without help (in that case, I found that I need to train more :grin:)<br>
In the case of **js.html**, I tried a login page that I saw at Youtube, that is why the code is better organized and better written

### index.html
That was my first code by myself. I could've make some things better, for example, the last part of the code was just tests of list, that's why in a real site it became strange and ugly. The CSS part of the code was in the same code as the HTML, I could've create another file just for the CSS, even because I did that in others projects and was so much better to control everything, the CSS I coded wasn't good enough for me too, I had problems to know what I do to bring my ideas into the code, a major problem doing that projects (all of them) was to center the items using *align-items* or *display: flex*, never working the way I wanted.
